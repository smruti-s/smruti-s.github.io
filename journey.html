							<h1>About Me</h1>
								<p>From a young age, I have been captivated by machines and instruments. This curiosity led to 
									becoming my fatherâ€™s assistant for home repairs. I loved tinkering with the various mechanics, 
									electronics, and robotics kits I received as birthday gifts. Designing and building a proof-of-concept 
									aqua robot for disaster relief in 8th grade helped me appreciate the positive impact robotics could have 
									on the world. My passion for pursuing an education and career in robotics stems from a deep-seated desire 
									to use technology to help people in need, particularly in aid and rescue scenarios.</p>
								<p>My undergraduate studies in Electronics and Instrumentation was structured to build a strong foundation in 
									robotics. My continued interest in Mathematics and Computation, along with courses like Control Systems, 
									Data Structures & Algorithms, and Microcontroller based system design enabled me to develop vital skills 
									in control design, programming, logic-forming, and problem-solving.</p>
								<p>I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Robotics and a graduate certificate in Engineering Leadership 
									from Northeastern University, Boston. </p>
							<h1>Hobbies</h1>
								<p>I like to be outdoors, and I used to be an athlete so I enjoy most outdoor activities like hiking, camping, 
									biking, rock climbing, etc. I love reading! Mystery, Thriller, and Fantasy are my favorite genres. 
									I am an anime and manga lover as well. I also like to do origami occasionally.</p>
