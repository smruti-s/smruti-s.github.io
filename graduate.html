							<h1>Graduate Research</h1>
							<p>
							I worked as a graduate research assistant in the Robotics and Intelligent Vehicles 
							Research Laboratory (RIVeR) advised by Prof. Taskin Padir. My journey as a graduate student 
							started with very little knowledge about the various specializations within robotics but with a desire 
							to learn how to design robots that can assist humans in dangerous situations. 
							<ol>
								<h2><li>PARIS - Precise Air sealing Robot for Inaccessible Spaces</h2></li>
									<p>This was the first project I worked on as a graduate student. The robot was being developed 
									   as part of the the E-ROBOT competition organized by the U.S. Department of Energy. The purpose 
									   of the competition was to encourage the design and development of robot prototypes that could help 
									   increase the energy efficiency in New England homes by assisting the workers for air sealing in attics.
									   My contributions were as follows:
										<ul>
											<li> Played a key role in robot development by taking the initiative to troubleshoot issues and 
												come up with innovative solutions.</li>
											<li>Achieved complete integration of custom-end effector with an off-the-shelf 5 DOF arm by
												modifying the URDF and MoveIt configuration package. Performed ROS integration for
												actuation of trigger module in the end-effector hence enabling motion planning for precision
												air sealing.</li>
											<li>Led mapping and navigation efforts to implement RTAB-Map for SLAM using RGBD cameras
												despite lack of meaningful wheel encoder data. Implemented closed-loop speed control on the
												mobile robot to achieve smooth navigation in attic space environments.</li>
										</ul> </p>
									<p>By working on this project, I was able to perceive the value of using robots in environments that have 
										inadequate space for human workers to perform tasks like air-sealing or inspection and are also hazardous 
										due to the presence of risky chemical and electrical components. I was also able to broaden system 
										integration, robot perception, and navigation in cluttered environments and inaccessible spaces like attics.</p>
		
								<h2><li>Health Assistant Mobile Robot</li></h2>
									<p>After PARIS, I worked on a health assistant robot involving multi-modal sensing and system integration as a 
									   part of an inter-disciplinary team. The robot monitored and assisted patients in their homes or care facilities.</p>
